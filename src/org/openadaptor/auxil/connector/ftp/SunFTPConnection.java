/**
 * This component will provide basic File Transfer Protocol (FTP) connunication to allow the adaptor to GET a file from
 * or PUT a file onto a remote machine. <p/>
 * 
 * The methods return FTP input/output streams to the caller which can then be used to either read a file from or write
 * a file to the remote server. <p/>
 * 
 * Uses the standard sun.net.ftp.FtpClient and sun.net.TelnetInputStream classes to perform the actual file transfer.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * NB: the Sun libraries are subject to change between JDK releases. A case in point is if you specify a wildcard in the
 * filename. Under JDK 1.4 the source will retrieve each file that matches the file pattern on subsequent polls pretty
 * much as you would expect. However, if you use JDK 1.3 then it will only retrieve the first file that matches and then
 * empty files for the rest.
